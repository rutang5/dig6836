# Loops, Lists, and Linguistics

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding of loops, lists, and their application in solving linguistic problems. You will write Python programs that manipulate lists of words and perform various linguistic tasks using loops and conditional statements.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Word Length Counter
Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence. The program should then count the number of words in the sentence and display the average word length. Use a loop and a list to accomplish this task.

### Part 2: Vowel Counter
Write a program that asks the user to enter a word. The program should count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the word and display the count. Use a loop and a list to accomplish this task.

### Part 3: Palindrome Detector
Write a program that asks the user to enter a word. The program should check if the word is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and display an appropriate message. Use a loop and a list to accomplish this task.

### Part 4: Word Reversal
Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence. The program should reverse the order of the words in the sentence and display the reversed sentence. Use a loop and a list to accomplish this task.

### Part 5: Letter Frequency Counter
Write a program that asks the user to enter a word or sentence. The program should count the frequency of each letter (case-insensitive) in the input and display the results. Use a loop, a list, and a dictionary to accomplish this task.

### Bonus: Pig Latin Translator (Optional)
Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence. The program should translate the sentence into Pig Latin. Follow the rules of Pig Latin:
- If a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add "ay" to the end of the word.
- If a word starts with a consonant, move the consonant to the end of the word and add "ay" to the end.
- Preserve the punctuation and spacing in the original sentence.
Use loops, lists, and string manipulation techniques to accomplish this task.

## Submission Guidelines
- Create a single Python file containing all the programs for each part.
- Add comments to explain your code.
- Test your programs with different inputs to ensure they work correctly.
- Submit your Python file via the specified method.

Note: Feel free to explore additional linguistic tasks or expand on the given ones. Have fun and happy coding!
