# Assignment: Clipboard Collage - The Nonsense Poetry Generator

## Assignment Description

In this programming assignment, you will create a Python program using the `pyperclip` library to generate nonsense poetry from the contents of your clipboard. The program will randomly combine and rearrange the words, creating unique and imaginative verses. Get ready to dive into the world of creativity and humor!

Here are the steps to complete the assignment:

1. **Install the `pyperclip` library:**
   - Open your command prompt or terminal.
   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```
     pip install pyperclip
     ```

2. **Import the necessary libraries:**
   - Begin your Python program by importing the `pyperclip` and `random` libraries.

3. **Retrieve the clipboard content:**
   - Use the `pyperclip.paste()` function to retrieve the text content of your clipboard and store it in a variable.

4. **Process the clipboard text:**
   - Split the clipboard content into individual words and store them in a list using the `split()` method.
   - Remove any leading or trailing punctuation from the words using the `strip()` method.

5. **Generate the nonsense poetry:**
   - Shuffle the list of words randomly using the `random.shuffle()` method from the `random` library.
   - Combine the shuffled words into poetic lines by grouping them together using string manipulation.
   - Add additional creative touches, such as adding line breaks and punctuation, to enhance the poetry's aesthetic.

6. **Display and copy the generated poetry:**
   - Print the generated poetry to the console.
   - Use the `pyperclip.copy()` function to copy the poetry to your clipboard, allowing you to easily share it with others.

7. **Test and experiment:**
   - Run your program multiple times to generate different variations of nonsense poetry.
   - Feel free to modify the program to add your own creative twists, such as implementing rhyme schemes or incorporating specific themes.

8. **Submit your work:**
   - Once you are satisfied with your program, submit the Python script or Jupyter Notebook file, along with a few examples of the nonsense poetry generated by your program.

Remember to have fun and let your imagination run wild while creating your clipboard collage of nonsense poetry! Good luck and happy coding!

**Note:** It's important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions before accessing and processing the contents of your clipboard.
